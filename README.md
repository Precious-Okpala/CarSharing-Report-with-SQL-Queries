## SQL Queries
1. Highest demand rate in 2017:
- Query to find the exact date and time when the highest demand occurred in 2017.
2. Average demand rates by Weekday, Month, and Season; Query to;
- (2A) Calculate the weekday, month, and season with the highest average demand in 2017.
- (2B) Calculate the weekday, month, and season with the lowest average demand in 2017.
3. Hourly demand rates for the selected weekday(s) in 2017:
- Query to calculate the average demand for each hour of the selected weekday(s) from (b).
4. Weather analysis for 2017:
- (4a) Determine whether 2017 was mostly cold, mild, or hot, based on temperature categories.
- (4b) Identify the most frequent weather condition (from the weather column).
- (4c) Provide monthly statistics for:
- (i) Wind speed: average, highest, and lowest
- (ii) Humidity: average, highest, and lowest
- (4d) Calculate the average demand for cold, mild, and hot weather categories.
5. Weather analysis for the highest demand month in 2017:
- (5a) Identify the month with the highest average demand in 2017.
- (5b) Repeat the weather-related analysis from (4) for that month only (i.e., cold/mild/hot classification, wind speed, humidity, and average demand).

## Instructions
